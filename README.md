## Selection Mode

Depending on the selection mode, you can specify the following three selection methods.

### 1. `CalendarSelectionMode.single` for selecting one date.

Allows to select a single date, selecting a new date will remove the selection for previous date and updates selection to the new selected date.

```

### 2. `CalendarSelectionMode.multiple` for selection of multiple dates.

        }
    },
)
```

### 3. `CalendarSelectionMode.range` Allows to select a single range of dates.

            'start: ${dateRange.start}, end: ${dateRange.end}',
        );
    },
)
```

## How to change style

There are two main ways to style that calendar widget.

### 1. To change the style of text.

You can change the text style by injecting a CalendarTextStyle instance.

#### Example

```dart
FlutterCalendar(
    selectionMode: CalendarSelectionMode.single,
    textStyle: const CalendarTextStyle(
        dayFontSize: 16,
        dayTextColor: Colors.blue,
    ),
)
```

### 2. To change the style except for text.

Styles other than text styles can be changed by injecting an instance of CalendarStyle.

#### Example

```dart

```
